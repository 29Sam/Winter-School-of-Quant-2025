This repository contains my work from the Winter School of Quantitative Finance 2025, conducted by the Finance Club, IIT Bombay.

The project focuses on implementing core quantitative finance algorithms, including:
- Mean–variance portfolio optimization and efficient frontier construction
- Option pricing using Black–Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations
- Portfolio risk estimation using Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall

The implementations emphasize correctness, clarity, and practical applicability.
